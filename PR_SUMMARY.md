## Title
Refactor Area Details Page: Remove Area Card, Add Filter Icon, Fix Map Reinitialization Bug

## Problem Statement

### Issue 1: UI/UX Improvements Needed
The Area Details page had several UI issues:
- Redundant area name card (name already in top app bar)
- Text-based filter toggle was not intuitive
- No visual feedback for active filters
- Poor integration between map and filter components

### Issue 2: Map Selection Bug
When users selected a sector on the SVG map and scrolled down then back up, the selected sector (red highlight) would be lost. This was caused by the WebView being recomposed and losing its JavaScript state.

## Solution

### UI Refactoring
1. **Removed Area Name Card** - Eliminated redundant information, simplified layout
2. **Added Filter Icon** - Replaced text toggle with Settings icon button
3. **Visual Feedback** - Icon turns blue when filters are active or panel is open
4. **Better Layout** - Search and filter button in single row, map moved to top

### Bug Fix
Implemented state preservation in the WebView:
- Store selected sector ID from ViewModel
- Inject it into JavaScript on WebView updates
- Restore selection state on DOM load
- Maintain state in JavaScript click handlers

## Changes

### Code Changes
- **1 file modified**: `app/src/main/java/com/example/topoclimb/ui/screens/AreaDetailScreen.kt`
- **59 lines added, 64 lines removed** (net: -5 lines)
- Added Settings icon import
- Removed area info card from LazyColumn
- Enhanced WebView JavaScript for state persistence
- Refactored FilterSection with icon button

### Documentation Added
