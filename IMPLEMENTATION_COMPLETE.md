- **3 existing files** modified

## Feature Highlights

### 1. Data Layer
- Complete data model matching API response structure
- Proper serialization with Gson annotations
- Support for all log fields including user info, metadata, and comments

### 2. Network Layer
- New API endpoint: `GET /routes/{route}/logs`
- Returns `LogsResponse` with list of logs
- Integrated with existing Retrofit setup

### 3. ViewModel Layer
- Extended `RouteDetailUiState` with:
  - `logs: List<Log>` - The fetched logs
  - `isLogsLoading: Boolean` - Loading state
  - `logsError: String?` - Error handling
- Automatic logs fetching when route details load
- Proper error handling and state management

### 4. UI Layer
Completely redesigned LogsTab with:

#### Filter System
- Toggle switch to show all logs or only logs with comments
- Real-time filtering
- Visual feedback showing current filter state

#### Log Cards
Each log displayed in a modern Material Design 3 card with:
- User avatar (40dp circular, with fallback to initials)
- Username and formatted timestamp
- Verified badge (green) when applicable
- Three color-coded badges:
  - **Type**: Flash (orange), Redpoint (blue), Onsight (green)
  - **Way**: Bouldering, Sport, Trad, etc.
  - **Grade**: Numeric grade value
- Comments section (only shown when comments exist)

#### States
- Loading: Centered progress indicator
- Error: Clear error message display
- Empty: Appropriate message based on filter state
- Content: Scrollable list of log cards

## Design Principles

### Material Design 3
- Uses Material Design 3 components throughout
- Proper elevation and surface colors
- Consistent typography hierarchy
- Appropriate spacing and padding

### Color Coding
- **Flash**: Amber/Orange (#FFB74D / #E65100)
- **Redpoint**: Blue (#64B5F6 / #0D47A1)
- **Onsight**: Green (#81C784 / #1B5E20)
- **Verified**: Green with checkmark (#4CAF50)
- Consistent with Material Design color palettes

### User Experience
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive filtering
- Responsive loading states
- Graceful error handling
- Smooth scrolling
- Efficient image loading with Coil

## Quality Assurance

### Build Status
✅ **Build Successful**: All builds pass without errors or warnings
✅ **Tests Pass**: All unit tests pass
✅ **No New Warnings**: Clean compilation

### Code Review
✅ Addressed all code review feedback
✅ Made `loadRouteLogs` private for better encapsulation
✅ Added documentation for grade field
✅ Follows existing project patterns

### Documentation
✅ Technical implementation summary (LOGS_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md)
✅ UI/UX design documentation (LOGS_UI_DESIGN.md)
✅ Inline code comments where needed
✅ Clear commit messages

## API Integration

### Endpoint
```
GET /routes/{route}/logs
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 7,
      "route_id": 9,
      "comments": "",
      "type": "flash",
      "way": "bouldering",
      "grade": 600,
      "created_at": "2025-10-03T10:18:24.000000Z",
      "is_verified": true,
      "user_name": "Paulhenry",
      "user_pp_url": "https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=P&color=7F9CF5&background=EBF4FF"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

Potential improvements that could be added later:
- Grade formatting to human-readable climbing grades
- Pull-to-refresh for logs
- Sorting options (by date, grade, user)
- User profile navigation from avatar click
- Add new log functionality
- Edit/delete own logs
- Like/comment on logs
- Statistics and analytics view

## Testing Recommendations

For manual testing:
1. Open the app and navigate to any route
2. Tap on a route to open the bottom sheet
3. Switch to the "Logs" tab
4. Verify logs are loading
5. Test the "With Comments" filter toggle
6. Verify all badges are displayed correctly
7. Check avatar loading and fallback
8. Test with routes that have no logs
9. Test error handling by simulating network failure

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully fulfills all requirements from the problem statement:
- ✅ Fetches logs from `/routes/{route}/logs` endpoint
- ✅ Displays logs on the second tab of BottomRouteSheet
- ✅ Provides filter for logs with/without comments
- ✅ Shows grade, way, and type with badges
- ✅ Modern, clean UI design
- ✅ Displays user information properly

The feature is production-ready and follows all best practices for Android development with Jetpack Compose and Material Design 3.
