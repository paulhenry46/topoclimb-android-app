# Pull-to-Refresh and Backend Cache Fix Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the fixes applied to address two issues from the previous pull request:
1. Use PullToRefreshBox instead of refresh button
2. Backend URL changes not reflecting when returning to sites and refreshing

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Use PullToRefreshBox
**Problem:** The previous implementation used a refresh button in the TopAppBar, but the requirement was to use Material3's `PullToRefreshBox` component which is available in the version being used (Material3 1.3.1 from compose-bom 2024.12.01).

**Solution:** 
- Removed the refresh button (`IconButton` with `Icons.Default.Refresh`) from all three screen's TopAppBar
- Wrapped the content in `PullToRefreshBox` component
- Connected the `isRefreshing` state to the existing ViewModel state
- Connected the `onRefresh` callback to the existing refresh methods

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive user experience - users can pull down to refresh
- Follows Material Design 3 guidelines
- Standard Android pattern that users are familiar with
- Cleaner UI without the manual refresh button

### Issue 2: Backend URL Changes Not Reflecting
**Problem:** When a user changed the URL of an API backend, returned to the sites screen, and refreshed, the data didn't change. This was because the `MultiBackendRetrofitManager` cached API instances by backend ID, and when a backend URL was updated, it continued using the old cached instance.

**Solution:**
- Added a coroutine scope to `FederatedTopoClimbRepository` that observes backend configuration changes
- Whenever the backend configuration changes (detected via the `backends` StateFlow), the Retrofit cache is cleared
- This ensures that the next API call will create a new Retrofit instance with the updated URL

**Technical Implementation:**
```kotlin
private val scope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Default)

init {
    // Clear retrofit cache when backends are updated
    scope.launch {
        backendConfigRepository.backends.collect {
            retrofitManager.clearCache()
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Backend URL changes are immediately reflected
- No manual intervention needed
- Works automatically for all backend operations
- Maintains data consistency

## Files Modified

### 1. SitesScreen.kt
**Changes:**
- Removed `Icons.Default.Refresh` import
- Added `androidx.compose.material3.pulltorefresh.PullToRefreshBox` import
- Removed refresh button from TopAppBar actions
- Wrapped LazyColumn content in `PullToRefreshBox`
- Removed manual loading indicator (PullToRefreshBox handles this)

**Before:**
```kotlin
TopAppBar(
    title = { Text("Climbing Sites") },
    actions = {
        IconButton(onClick = { viewModel.refreshSites() }) {
            Icon(Icons.Default.Refresh, "Refresh")
        }
    }
)
```

**After:**
```kotlin
TopAppBar(
    title = { Text("Climbing Sites") }
)
// ... in content section:
PullToRefreshBox(
    isRefreshing = uiState.isRefreshing,
    onRefresh = { viewModel.refreshSites() }
) {
    LazyColumn { /* content */ }
}
```

### 2. SiteDetailScreen.kt
**Changes:**
- Removed `Icons.Default.Refresh` import
- Added `androidx.compose.material3.pulltorefresh.PullToRefreshBox` import
- Removed refresh button from TopAppBar actions
- Wrapped LazyColumn content in `PullToRefreshBox`
- Removed manual loading indicator

### 3. AreaDetailScreen.kt
**Changes:**
- Removed `Icons.Default.Refresh` import
- Added `androidx.compose.material3.pulltorefresh.PullToRefreshBox` import
- Removed refresh button from TopAppBar actions
- Wrapped LazyColumn content in `PullToRefreshBox`
- Removed manual loading indicator

### 4. FederatedTopoClimbRepository.kt
**Changes:**
- Added imports: `CoroutineScope`, `Dispatchers`, `SupervisorJob`, `launch`
- Added `private val scope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Default)`
- Added init block that observes backend changes and clears Retrofit cache
- Added clarifying comment about scope lifetime

## Testing

### Build Testing
- ✅ Debug build successful
- ✅ Release build successful
- ✅ All unit tests pass

### Manual Testing Recommendations
To verify the fixes work correctly:

#### Test 1: Pull-to-Refresh Gesture
1. Open the Sites screen
2. Pull down on the list of sites
3. Verify that:
   - A loading indicator appears
   - The list refreshes and shows updated data
   - The loading indicator disappears when complete

4. Repeat for Site Detail and Area Detail screens

#### Test 2: Backend URL Changes
1. Open the app and note the sites displayed
2. Go to Profile → Manage Backends
3. Edit a backend and change its URL to a different server
4. Save the changes
5. Return to Sites screen
6. Pull down to refresh
7. Verify that:
   - The sites list updates to show data from the new URL
   - The backend name is still correct
   - No cached data from the old URL is displayed

#### Test 3: Auto-Refresh on Backend Changes
1. Open the Sites screen
2. Go to Profile → Manage Backends
3. Add, remove, enable, or disable a backend
4. Return to Sites screen
5. Verify that the list automatically refreshes (existing functionality should still work)

## Technical Notes

### PullToRefreshBox API
- Available since Material3 1.3.0
- Part of `androidx.compose.material3.pulltorefresh` package
- Marked as `@ExperimentalMaterial3Api`
- Handles the pull gesture and visual feedback automatically
- Takes `isRefreshing: Boolean` and `onRefresh: () -> Unit` parameters

### Coroutine Scope Lifetime
The coroutine scope in `FederatedTopoClimbRepository` is application-scoped and lives for the lifetime of the repository, which is typically the application lifetime. This is acceptable because:
- The repository is created per context and reused
- The scope only contains one Flow collection job
- The app lifecycle naturally handles cleanup
- Using a lifecycle-aware scope would add unnecessary complexity for this use case

### Backend Cache Clearing
The `MultiBackendRetrofitManager.clearCache()` method:
- Clears all cached Retrofit API instances
- Forces recreation of instances on next use
- Ensures URL changes are reflected immediately
- Thread-safe operation

## Comparison with Previous Implementation

### Previous Approach
- Manual refresh button in TopAppBar
- Backend URL changes cached and not reflected
- Required user to click button to refresh
- Loading indicator shown separately

### New Approach
- Pull-to-refresh gesture (more intuitive)
- Automatic cache clearing on backend changes
- Native Material Design 3 component
- Integrated loading indicator

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Add haptic feedback for pull-to-refresh gesture
2. Implement smarter cache invalidation (only clear affected backends)
3. Add offline support with cached data
4. Show toast notification when backend configuration changes
5. Add pull-to-refresh to other scrollable screens if needed

## Conclusion

Both issues from the problem statement have been successfully resolved:
- ✅ PullToRefreshBox is now used for refresh functionality
- ✅ Backend URL changes are properly reflected when refreshing

The implementation is clean, maintainable, and follows Material Design 3 guidelines. All existing functionality is preserved while improving the user experience.
