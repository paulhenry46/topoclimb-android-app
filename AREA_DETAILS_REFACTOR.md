# Area Details Page Refactor - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the Area Details page to improve UI/UX and fix the map reinitialization bug.

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: UI/UX Improvements

**Problem Statement:**
- Area name card was redundant (area name already in top app bar)
- Filter panel lacked a clear visual indicator
- UI hierarchy needed simplification
- Better integration between map and filter components was requested

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Removed Area Info Card**: Eliminated the card displaying area name, description, and location (lines 94-123)
   - Area name is already visible in the top app bar
   - Simplifies the page layout
   - Reduces visual clutter
   
2. **Added Filter Icon**: Replaced text-based "Show filters" toggle with a Settings icon button
   - More intuitive visual representation
   - Icon button changes background color when:
     - Filter panel is open (blue/primary color)
     - Active filters are applied (blue/primary color)
   - Provides clear visual feedback about filter state
   
3. **Improved Filter Panel Layout**:
   - Search bar and filter icon now in a single row
   - Better use of horizontal space
   - Cleaner, more modern design
   - Removed text toggle button, replaced with icon-only button

### Issue 2: Map Reinitialization Bug

**Problem Statement:**
When a user:
1. Selects a sector on the SVG map (turns red)
2. Scrolls down to view routes
3. Scrolls back up to see the map

The selected sector would lose its red highlight because the WebView was being reinitialized.

**Root Cause:**
- Jetpack Compose's `AndroidView` recomposes when scrolled off-screen and back
- Each recomposition calls the `update` block
- The WebView HTML was being reloaded without preserving the selected state
- JavaScript selection state was lost on page reload

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **State Preservation in Update Block**:
```kotlin
update = { webView ->
    // Get the currently selected sector to restore after reload
    val selectedSectorId = uiState.selectedSectorId
    
    val htmlContent = """
        ...
        var currentSelectedSectorId = ${if (selectedSectorId != null) "'sector_$selectedSectorId'" else "null"};
        ...
    """
}
```

2. **JavaScript State Restoration**:
```javascript
// Store selected sector ID globally
var currentSelectedSectorId = ${if (selectedSectorId != null) "'sector_$selectedSectorId'" else "null"};

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const paths = document.querySelectorAll('svg path');
    
    // Restore selected state if exists
    if (currentSelectedSectorId) {
        const selectedPath = document.getElementById(currentSelectedSectorId);
        if (selectedPath) {
            selectedPath.classList.add('selected');
        }
    }
    ...
});
```

3. **Maintaining State in JavaScript**:
- Updated click handlers to maintain `currentSelectedSectorId` variable
- When sector is clicked: `currentSelectedSectorId = path.id;`
- When sector is deselected: `currentSelectedSectorId = null;`

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **app/src/main/java/com/example/topoclimb/ui/screens/AreaDetailScreen.kt**
   - Lines 9-12: Added Settings icon import
   - Lines 94-135: Removed area info card, map moved to top
   - Lines 136-290: Updated WebView HTML generation with state restoration
   - Lines 407-451: Refactored filter section with icon button

### Key Changes

#### 1. Icon Import
```kotlin
import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.Settings
```

#### 2. Removed Area Card
```kotlin
// REMOVED:
item {
    Card(...) {
        Column(...) {
            Text(area.name, ...)
            Text(area.description, ...)
            Text("Location: ...", ...)
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Filter Section
```kotlin
// BEFORE:
OutlinedTextField(...) // Full width
Spacer(...)
Row {
    Text("Show filters")
    TextButton { Text("▼") }
}

// AFTER:
Row {
    OutlinedTextField(..., modifier = Modifier.weight(1f))
    IconButton {
        Icon(Icons.Default.Settings, ...)
    }
}
```

#### 4. Map State Preservation
```kotlin
// Inject selected sector ID into JavaScript
var currentSelectedSectorId = ${if (selectedSectorId != null) "'sector_$selectedSectorId'" else "null"};

// Restore on page load
if (currentSelectedSectorId) {
    const selectedPath = document.getElementById(currentSelectedSectorId);
    if (selectedPath) {
        selectedPath.classList.add('selected');
    }
}
```

## Benefits

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Cleaner Layout**: Removed redundant information
2. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Map and filters are more prominent
3. **Improved Discoverability**: Filter icon is more intuitive than text
4. **Visual Feedback**: Icon color indicates filter state
5. **Space Efficiency**: Search and filter button in same row

### Bug Fix Benefits
1. **Persistent Selection**: Selected sector remains highlighted after scrolling
2. **Better UX**: Users can scroll freely without losing context
3. **Reliable State**: Selection state survives WebView recomposition
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved

## Testing

### Build Verification
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
# BUILD SUCCESSFUL
